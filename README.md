# Analysis of Modified Run Length Encoding Scheme with Introduction of Bit Stuffing for efficient Data Compression

**Abstract: **
This paper presents a modified scheme for run length encoding. A significant improvement in compression ratio for almost any kind of data can be achieved by the proposed  scheme. All the limitations and problems in the original run length encoding scheme have been highlighted and discussed in detail in this research paper. A proposed solution has been suggested and performed for each problem to achieve intelligent  and  efficient  coding. One of the  major  problems with original design is that a larger number of bits are used to represent length of each run. This has been resolved by introducing bit stuffing in **RLE**. Such larger sequences that affects compression ratio are broken into small sequences using bit stuffing. To allow more compression and flexibility, the length of maximum allowable bit sequence is not fixed and can be adjusted with input. Secondly we ignore the large numbers of small sequences that are largely responsible for expansion of data instead of compression. Four random sequences have been analyzed and when applied by modified scheme, a compression ratio of as high as 50% is observed.
