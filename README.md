This paper presents a modified scheme for run length encoding. A significant improvement in compression ratio for almost any kind of data can be achieved by the proposed  scheme.  
All the limitations and problems in the original run length encoding scheme have been highlighted and discussed in detail in this research paper. 
A proposed solution has been suggested and performed for each problem to achieve intelligent  and  efficient  coding.  
One  of  the  major  problems with original design is that a larger number of bits are used to represent length of each run.   
This   has   been   resolved   by  introducing  bit  stuffing  in  RLE.  
Such  larger  sequences  that affects  compression  ratio  are  broken  into  small  sequences using  bit  stuffing.  
To  allow  more  compression  and  flexibility, the length of maximum allowable bit sequence is not fixed and can  be  adjusted  with  input.    
Secondly  we  ignore  the  large  numbers  of  small  sequences  that  are  largely  responsible  for expansion   of   data   instead   of   compression.   
Four random sequences have been analyzed and when applied by modified scheme, a compression ratio of as high as 50% is observed.
